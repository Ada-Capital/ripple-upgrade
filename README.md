ripple
======

Go packages to interact with the Ripple protocol.

Documentation, as it is improved, will be visible [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/donovanhide/ripple)

This is very much a work in progress. There is a lot of code to tidy up and not all of it is currently present in this repository. If you'd like to help, more tests and docs are welcome. If you'd like to refactor a section, please raise an issue and let's discuss the idea before writing any code.

The hope is one day that these packages might lay the foundations for an alternative implementation of the [Ripple daemon](https://github.com/ripple/rippled). This is, however, a long way off!

Please bear in mind that this has been an exercise that has taken a lot of time, so if you want to help and are not a developer, bounties and thanks are more than welcome here:
