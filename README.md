ripple
======

Go packages to interact with the Ripple protocol.

Documentation, as it is improved, will be visible [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/donovanhide/ripple)

This is very much a work in progress. There is a lot of code to tidy up and not all of it is currently present in this repository. If you'd like to help, more tests and docs are welcome. If you'd like to refactor a section, please raise an issue and let's discuss the idea before writing any code.

The peers, ledger and websockets packages are the least polished packages currently, and they are very much unfinished (and the tests might be non-existent or non-functional), but better to get the code out in the open.

I'll add some simple tools in the next week or two which demonstrate how to use the packages.

The hope is one day that these packages might lay the foundations for an alternative implementation of the [Ripple daemon](https://github.com/ripple/rippled). This is, however, a long way off!

Please bear in mind that this has been an exercise that has taken a lot of time, so if you want to help and are not a developer, bounties and thanks are more than welcome here:
